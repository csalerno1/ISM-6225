        1. Turn the Instant Pot on the saute setting. Add a drizzle of olive oil and let it heat up. <br><br>
        2. Add the ground beef. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. Cook beef, breaking it up and stirring
        occasionally, until browned. <br> Turn off the Instant Pot by selecting "Cancel". <br><br>
        3. Slice the onion and cabbage into bite-size pieces. <br>Add onion to Instant Pot first, then add as much cabbage
        that will fit in the pot without pushing it down <br>(Leave a little room at the top) <br><br>
        4. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and kidney beans (optional). <br><br>
        5. Add as much beef broth as it takes to fill the pot to the top. <br><br>
        6. Add the oregano, basil, and as much salt and pepper as desired. Stir the mixture. <br><br>
        7. Secure the lid on the Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. <br><br>
        8. Once the soup is done cooking, do an instant pressure release. <br>Add additional seasoning such as 
        salt and pepper as necessary. <br><br>
        9. Dish out the soup and add a small spoonful of sour cream as an optional garnish.
